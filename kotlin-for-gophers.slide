- Kotlin is a a statically typed, compiled, open source developed by Jetbrains in 2010
- Conceived by Dmitry Jemerov due to shortcomings of most other languages for the JVM
- 100% Interoperable with Java (Meaning you get access to all the libraries you know and love!)
- Extremely concise, expressive, and pragmatic (much like Go)

    "First and foremost, it's about our own productivity. We are still writing all of our IntelliJ 
     based IDEs almost entirely in Java. We want to become more productive by switching to a more 
     expressive language. At the same time, we cannot accept compromises in terms of either Java 
     interoperability or compilation speed."

      -- Dmitry Jemerov "Why JetBrains needs Kotlin" (https://goo.gl/xyXKMQ)
