* What is Legacy Code

* Defining Legacy Code

    "Legacy Code is simply code without tests. Code without tests is bad code. It doesn't matter
     how well written it is; it doesn't matter how pretty or object-oriented or well-encapsulated
     it is. With tests, we can change the behavior of our code quickly and verifiably. Without them,
     we really don't know if our code is getting better or worse."

      -- Michael Feathers "Working Effectively With Legacy Code"

* Modifying Legacy Code

* Modifying Legacy Code: The Dilemma

    When we change code, we ought to have tests in place. 
    To get tests in place, we often have to change code.

* Modifying Legacy Code: The General Algorithm

1. Identify change points.
2. Find test points.
3. Break dependencies.
4. Write tests.
5. Make changes and refactor.

* Legacy Code Techniques: Making changes when time is short

* Legacy Code Techniques: Sprout Method/Class

- Test driving a net NEW method/class implementation with the added functionality

* Workshop: The Case of the Gnarly Exception Handler

Context:

- This is a derivation of a piece of a real production system
- It was originally developed under a huge time crunch with limited Resources

Domain/Ubiquitous Language:

- Pick: a single task on the warehouse floor (i.e. grabbing a thing from a shelf)
- Consolidation: the system/place in the warehouse where parts of an order come together for shipment.
- Straggler: a part of an order which hasn't shown up in consolidation yet.
- WMS: Warehouse management system.
- Anything I missed feel free to ask!

Your task:

- Recently the operations manager introduced a new procedure on the fulfillment floor in that Picks now have a *TRIAGE* status which indicates that the pick is being triaged by a special team of pickers. 
- Unfortunately, this has caused the *ExceptionHandler* to have a bug in it's pick completion handling logic. Since this process change, the Ops Manager noticed that updates aren't appropriately flowing through to the Consoldation system downstream.
